### Automated Testing

**Performance Test Script:**
#!/bin/bash
echo "Testing multiple concurrent connections..."

Start 10 clients simultaneously
for i in {1..10}; do
timeout 30 ./client 127.0.0.1 &
echo "Started client $i"
sleep 0.1
done

wait
echo "All clients finished"



**Memory Usage Test:**
While server is running with clients
ps aux | grep server

Monitor RSS column for memory usage




## 🔧 Configuration

### Server Configuration

**Port Configuration (server.c):**
#define PORT 8080 // Change port here



**Client Limits (server.c):**
#define MAX_CLIENTS 10 // Maximum concurrent clients
#define MAX_USERS 100 // Maximum total user accounts



**Buffer Size (both files):**
#define BUFFER_SIZE 2048 // Message buffer size

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Connection refused"
Error message
./client 127.0.0.1
Connection failed: Connection refused



**Cause:** Server not running or wrong IP/port
**Solution:**
1. Start server first
./server

2. Check server is listening
netstat -tulnp | grep 8080

3. Try localhost
./client localhost



#### "Permission denied" 
**Cause:** Missing directories or file permissions
**Solution:**
Create required directories
mkdir -p uploads downloads

Fix permissions
chmod 755 uploads downloads
chmod +x server client



#### "Login failed"
**Cause:** Wrong username/password or user doesn't exist
**Solution:**
Register new account
/register newuser newpass

Or check existing credentials


#### "File not found"
**Cause:** File doesn't exist or wrong path
**Solution:**
Check file exists
ls -la filename

Use full path if needed
put /full/path/to/file.txt



#### "Too many users"
**Cause:** Server reached MAX_CLIENTS limit
**Solution:**
- Increase MAX_CLIENTS in server.c and recompile
- Or wait for users to disconnect

### Debug Mode

**Add debug output (server.c):**
printf("[DEBUG] Client %d connected from %s\n",
client_socket, inet_ntoa(client_addr.sin_addr));



**Monitor System Resources:**
CPU and memory usage
top -p $(pgrep server)

Network connections
ss -tulnp | grep 8080

File descriptors
lsof -p $(pgrep server)
